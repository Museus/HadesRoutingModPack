  This mod uses PrintUtil to create a Debug Box that can be printed to by
  other mods.

  This mod will attempt to load first. This is so that other mods can update
  their config based on whether this mod is installed.

  For actual debugging, it is better to use the official DebugOverlay provided
  by Supergiant, but this can be used for players not running in debug-mode.

  Example:
    config.PrintToDebug = config.PrintToDebug and DebugBoxMod
